# netstat
No-dependnency command line util for checking network status

## Installation
- git clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/akhil0001/netstat.git`
- Run the command `npm install -g`

## Usage
- After installation just type `netstat` in your terminal
- Tada! It displays current status of network and displays
    1. Local network address
    2. IP address
    3. If you are connected to internet
    4. Is port `3000` available ?

## Why only port 3000 ?
- Because it is frequently used port by starter packs and it is quite annoying to run your custom built projects to check if there is a project and check terminals

- But you still can check if there is another port available by just typing port number like `netstat 8000`
